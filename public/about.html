<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Sean, a versatile solo game developer and full-stack
  enthusiast with a passion for crafting digital experiences. Beyond the lines
  of code, I find joy in bringing worlds to life through my love for 2D and 3D
  art.

  hats, steering projects from concept to completion. Whether it's coding
  intricate game mechanics, designing immersive narratives, or optimizing
  performance, I thrive on the dynamic challenges of solo game development.

<p>
  Artistic Flair: <br />Beyond the digital realm, my creative canvas extends to
  2D and 3D art. Exploring the interplay of colors, shapes, and dimensions is
  not just a hobbyâ€”it's a form of expression that adds depth to my approach in
  both development and design.
